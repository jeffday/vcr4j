VCR4J is a set of API's for controlling VCR's via various protocols. Currently,
VCR4J implements VCR control via RS422 (serial ports).

To use the VCR4J API, the following dependencies (jars) are required:
 - vcr4j 
 - mbarix4j
 - slf4j-api (and an slf4j implementation, see http://www.slf4j.org for more 
   details. slf4j-log4j12 and log4j are required to use log4j for logging and
   are included in this download)

If you plan on using any of the included swing components you will also 
need to include the following dependencies:
 - foxtrot

You will also need to install the RXTX libraries that allow the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) to use your computers serial ports. More details about 
installing RXTX can be found at http://users.frii.com/jarvi/rxtx/. The following
RXTX dependencies are included in the VCR4J download:
 - rxtx
 - librxtxSerial.so (linux native library)
 - librxtsSerial.jnilib (Mac OS X native library)
 - rxtxSerial.dll (Windows native library)
